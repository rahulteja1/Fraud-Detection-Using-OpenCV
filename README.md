# Fraud-Detection-Using-OpenCV
•	Developed a phishing detection system using machine learning algorithms and image comparison techniques to reduce online frauds and phishing attacks. 
•	Implemented the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) method to detect differences between two images, allowing us to determine if an image has been manipulated or tampered with. 
•	Utilized OpenCV, scikit-image, and Python to develop a system that compares logos and User Interface (UI) elements on web pages to an existing data-set, allowing for accurate and efficient detection of fraudulent web pages. 
•	Contributed to the ongoing effort to combat credit card fraud and other online frauds by utilizing machine learning and image comparison techniques to develop a sophisticated detection system.
