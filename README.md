# Fraud-Detection-Using-OpenCV
Developed a phishing detection system using machine learning algorithms and image comparison techniques to reduce online frauds and phishing attacks. 

Implemented the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) method to detect differences between two images, allowing us to determine if an image has been manipulated or tampered with. 

Utilized OpenCV, scikit-image, and Python to develop a system that compares logos and User Interface (UI) elements on web pages to an existing data-set, allowing for accurate and efficient detection of fraudulent web pages. 

Contributed to the ongoing effort to combat credit card fraud and other online frauds by utilizing machine learning and image comparison techniques to develop a sophisticated detection system.
